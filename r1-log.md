## Log

### R1D1 
Did a recap of JS and JSON activities on FreeCodeCamp. Started the Wikipedia project and build the basic framework.

### R1D2
Day 2: Worked on the Wikipedia project. Struggling with getting the Wikipedia API working. Did a lot of research but no luck so far. Hopefully, by tomorrow, I will have the basic functionality up. Fingers crossed.

### R1D3
Day 3: Finally got the Wikipedia API to work. Tomorrow will work on making the data look good.

### R1D4
Day 4: Wikipedia project complete. So proud. Great learning on API documentation.
