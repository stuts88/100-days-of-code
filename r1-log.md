Did a recap of JS and JSON activities on FreeCodeCamp. Started the Wikipedia project and build the basic framework.

### R1D8
Day 8: Worked on Intermediate Algorithm problems on #freecodecamp today. Really enjoying the problem-solving challenges at midnight.

### R1D9
Day 9: Took a break from JS and revised some git and CSS grid code. Never thought I would miss git back from my coding days.

### R1D10
Day 10: Continued doing CSS grid exercises. Grids are so powerful and flexible. Can't wait to use grids in a website project soon.
